# Sums

## Can Sum
Given a number `N`, and an array of numbers `numbers`, verify if you can recreate the target number `N` summing numbers from the `numbers` array.
Return true if it's possible to create the target number `N` summing numbers from the `numbers` array. Return false otherwise.

## How Sum

Like Can Sum, but return an array showing which numbers from the `numbers` when summed will produce the number `N`.

## Best Sum

Like Can Sum and How Sum, but should return an array with the minimum numbers from the `numbers` array that summed will produce the number `N`.
