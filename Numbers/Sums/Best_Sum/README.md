# Best Sum

A modification of the Can Sum and How Sum.
Having an array with all the possible ways to sum up to the target, return the array that has the less numbers which sum equals the target.

Example, having 

```js
howSum(7, [2, 4, 3, 7]);
```
The combination of numbers which sum equals 7 are:

[2,2,3]
[4,3]
[3,2,2]
[7]

The you should return [7] because that is the array that has the least combination to equal 7.
