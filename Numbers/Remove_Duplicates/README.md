### Remove Duplicates

Given a sorted array of integers in ascending order, modify the given array removing the duplicates. I.e, each element should appear only once. And print the resulting array and k, where k is the number of unique numbers in the array.

Examples:

Given numbers = [1,1,2]
Return: numbers = [1,2,] and k = 2, because there are 2 unique numbers.

Given numbers =  [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Return: numbers =  [0,1,2,3,4,,,,,] and k = 5, because there are 5 unique numbers.
