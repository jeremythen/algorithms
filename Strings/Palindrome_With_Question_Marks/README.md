# Palindrome With Question Marks

Write a function that given a string with some question marks, checks if it's possible to create a palindrome string replacing the question marks with the corresponding character on the other side of the string.
If there are 2 mirror question marks, then replace them by the character 'a'.
If no palindrome can be formed, return "NO".

Given "?ab??a" return "aabbaa"
Given "bab??a" return "NO"
